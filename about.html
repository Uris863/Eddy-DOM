    <p>The songs on his debut EP Kid have been described as a blend of traditional 
        chanson and hip-hop. In his live performances, he was accompanied only by a 
        drummer. The songs on the EP deal with themes such as the pressure to appear 
        masculine, homophobic violence, and the difficulty of finding one's identity. 
        His music has also been compared to Stromae on several occasions. De Pretto 
        himself further cites musicians such as Frank Ocean, Claude Nougaro, and Booba 
        as inspiration.
